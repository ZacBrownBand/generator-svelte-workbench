# generator-svelte-workbench [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url]
> A structured workspace for creating and packaging svelte components.

This workspace created by this generator comes with a few key features that helps you to start writting components sooner, maintain them, and distribute.  

It comes with [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) for module bundling and [Bublé](https://www.npmjs.com/package/buble) to allow for ES2015/16 JavaScript code to be used in your components without needing to worry about browser/environment support.  

The other main feature is the file structure that is supported. Rather than putting the css, html and js for a component in a single file, they are all split up and a gulp task takes care of the rest.  


## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-svelte-workbench using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-svelte-workbench
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo svelte-workbench
```
